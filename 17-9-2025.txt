Can we please get drive Q extended on the below servers by 500GB:
SORBSPSQLP01
SORBSPSQLP02
SETTSPSQLP21
The drive currently has less than 10% free space. INC005898722 has been generated by ServiceNow.

Erica - Pending Server Builds in next Quarter.
18/07/25 Requested Possibility of setting these up as Problem tickets / or how to handle the repeating disk space alerts.
From Compute: If you need disks larger than 2TB then you could request new disks partitioned as GPT and migrate the data between them.
SETTBISQLP04 - O Drive is using MBR instead of GPT so cannot be expanded more than it's current size.
SORBBISQLP04 - J and O Drive are both using MBR instead of GPT so cannot be expanded more than it's current size.
