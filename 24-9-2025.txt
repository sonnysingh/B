- TASK0954944 (INC006983674) -  Validation of Prod user on Travellers Cheques database.
Please review the User settings on the following to ensure the Service Account (user) is set up with standard Windows Authentication. 
sServer: SAUEESSQP01
Database: TravellersCheques
ServiceAccount: srvProdTravellersChe

Error Investigation Notes.
This error occurs coz the SQL Server connection attempt seems using integrated authentication (Windows) but user's domain is not trusted by the SQL server's domain or SQL Server cannot validate the Windows credentials due to networking/domain issues.
Possible Cause - Cross domain authentication ; Connection string misconfiguration or Double hop / Kerberos delegation issue
Possible solutions
1- SQL login for windows account which has validated and correctly configured.
2- Instead of Integrated authentication use SQL Server authentication (user & password) in connection string.
3- If multi-tier app then configure SPN and enable Kerberos delegation
Hope helps to understand.
