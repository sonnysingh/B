=- https://jira.nz.thenational.com/browse/DASD-2009 - 1.5 hrs
	- We are working on migrating our partydemographics database from SQLServer to Postgres RDS (AWS). As part of the migration preparation, the migration tool (AWS Database Migration Service) requires a db account created in SQLServer with admin privilege
- The SQL user account "COI_dms_migration" has been created as requested. The Requester (Toni) advised that migration has been postponed due to resource/capacity constraints, and asked to retain the user temporarily for testing. Due to elevated (db_owner) permissions, the account will be removed once requester confirms testing is complete. The Jira ticket will then be closed. Toni Angeles - Let us know once testing get completed.

Can we please get drive Q extended on the below servers by 500GB:
SORBSPSQLP01
SORBSPSQLP02
SETTSPSQLP21
The drive currently has less than 10% free space. INC005898722 has been generated by ServiceNow.



INC006591021 - settbisqlp04:Drive J: has 1% space left
Erica - Pending Server Builds in next Quarter.
18/07/25 Requested Possibility of setting these up as Problem tickets / or how to handle the repeating disk space alerts.
From Compute: If you need disks larger than 2TB then you could request new disks partitioned as GPT and migrate the data between them.
SETTBISQLP04 - O Drive is using MBR instead of GPT so cannot be expanded more than it's current size.
SORBBISQLP04 - J and O Drive are both using MBR instead of GPT so cannot be expanded more than it's current size.
