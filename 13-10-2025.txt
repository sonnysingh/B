- INC007055813 (Database - SQL Server SETTDMSQLD07  cannot be connected to) From [ Aseem Mohammed <Aseem_Mohammed@bnz.co.nz> ] 
We are unable to connect to the Dev SQL database(DBAPP-CRS-DEV/SETTDMSQLD07) and because of this out IIR dev application is down which is blocking our testing, could you please help us so that we are unblocked.
	- I tested the server and some databases specifically IIR database connectivity. Server and database connectivity is working without any issue. Could you please try and test the connectivity ? and let us know if any concern.
	- Caused - I recall this is the same server that had connectivity issues a month or so ago - it was related to its dns record getting scavenged. - Paul Cotter***
	- it has resolved the issue, but unfortunately it may occur again until the server is rebuilt.
This is a known issue with server OS's that are upgraded in-place, especially from Windows 2012
	
- INC007050853 (SETTDMSQLD07 - Unable to connect - 'connection error, failed due to kerberos error') - resolved
	- Requester Jeff Li comments "Thanks for the help. I could access it around an hour after the call. Although it was weird, access works fine now."
