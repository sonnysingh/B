Just a quick and rough peep Estimation migration time depend on following areas:-

Database Size – Impacts backup/restore or file copy duration.
Network Bandwidth & Latency – Critical for remote or cloud migrations; slower links prolong transfers.
Storage Speed – Source and target disk I/O affects all migration tasks.
Migration Method – Different approaches (backup/restore, detach/attach, log shipping, etc.) vary in complexity and speed.
Server Configuration – Includes memory settings, tempdb setup, MAXDOP, and installing required features.
Security & Access Setup – Copying logins and ensuring correct permissions avoid user issues.
Application Cutover – Time needed to update connection strings, DNS, or client endpoints.
Post‑Migration Validation – Testing data integrity, performance, and job schedules.
Rollback Planning – Buffer time in case of failure and need to revert.
Version/Edition Compatibility – Ensures no feature gaps or collate differences to fix.
