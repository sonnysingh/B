	- As credit card information is stored in our APEX database DBAPP-APEX(DBLST-APEX-PROD), we are wanting to understand who may
	 access this data so we can verify whether the PAN data is being exposed. We have been told that the DBAs may be able to help 
	provide a list of who connects to the database.  Is that correct? If so, can you please let me know how I can go about 
	getting this information from you?


- INC006802929 ( settdmsqlp29:Drive D: has 8% space left ) - 1.5 hrs
	- 'D' drive is hosting data files mdf/ndf of databases that participating in Log shipping. Primary SQL server is "SORBDMSQLP09" 
	and secondary "settdmsqlp29" which limits the possibility of shrink or move files. Space consumption is expected to increase due to 
	ongoing business data growth. Minimum expectation calculation for 20% free space for stable SQL server operations and to prevent 
	database growth failures.
	20% * 2.69 TB (total drive size) = 538 GB (approx.)
	Current free space = 217 GB
	Deficit = 538 - 217 = 321 GB
	So to reach 20% free space, need at least +321 GB to expand.
	If want to allow growth I'd suggest to expand the drive with 500 GB.
	Feel free to ask if any questions.
