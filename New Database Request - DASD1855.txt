To assist the requester in setting up a new SQL Server database for their ETL transformations in a BNZ-approved non-prod environment, you will need to gather some specific technical and compliance-related details. Here's a checklist of required information you should request:

---

### âœ… Database Setup Requirements

1. Database Name:

   Preferred name for the database (e.g., `Momentum_ETL_Transform`).

2. SQL Server Version Preference:

   Specify if any particular version (e.g., SQL Server 2019/2022) is required.

3. Environment Details:

   Confirm this is strictly for non-prod use, as they mentioned.

4. Size Estimate:

   Approximate data volume (initial and projected growth) to allocate adequate storage.

5. Retention Period:

   They mentioned one year. Confirm if auto-archival or deletion is expected after that.

6. Authentication Type:

   * SQL Authentication or Windows Authentication?

   * List of users who need access (AD groups or individual accounts).

---

### âœ… Access & Security

7. Data Sensitivity Classification:

   Even for non-prod, confirm whether data contains PII/sensitive information.

8. Network Access Requirements:

   * Will access be from BNZâ€™s internal network only?

   * Is VPN access needed?

9. Firewall Rules / Whitelisting:

   IP addresses or ranges that need access to the database.

---

### âœ… Usage & Integration

10. ETL Tool / Client Access Details:

* How will the user connect? (e.g., SSMS, Python scripts, Power BI, Azure Data Factory)

* Will Excel still be used for uploads/downloads?

11. Backup & Recovery Needs:

* Is daily backup sufficient?

* Do they need point-in-time recovery?

12. Logging and Auditing Requirements:

* Should audit trails of manual uploads or transformations be maintained?

---

### âœ… Governance & Approvals

13. BNZ Compliance Approval:

* Has the use of this environment been formally approved by BNZ InfoSec/IT?

* Any reference ticket or name of approver?

14. Requester Contact Details:

* Name, department, email, and project role (they mentioned they're in the "global data squad").

15. Decommissioning Plan:

* What happens after one year?

* Should the database be auto-deleted or archived?

If you like, I can prepare a template form/email to send to the requester for gathering this info. Just let me know.
