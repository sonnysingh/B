INC006774117 P3 (sorbspsqlp01:CPU Utilisation is at 100%) - 1 hr
- SQL server experienced 100% CPU utilization and the cause is executing INDEX command with extremely high CPU time and logical reads. Other contributing sessions include Select and Update and Delete commands from SQ Agent Jobs with moderate CPU and IO usage. The primary cause appears to be resource-intensive index maintenance. that seems executing from the host SETTSPWFEP06 , likely app server.
- SQL Server and Veeam backup processes are jointly driving CPU to 100%.
- Review Index Maintenance timing vs Veeam backup overlap and see the possibility of avoiding overlapping.
