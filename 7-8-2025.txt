- https://jira.nz.thenational.com/browse/DASD-2009
- I had a chat with Toni to discuss the access requirements for the upcoming database migration using AWS DMS tool. . Toni confirmed that a dedicated user account is required for each SQL server involved in the migration.

I recommended that assigning the db_owner role on the source databases, along with the View Server State permissions at the instance level, should be sufficient to perform the migration successfully. Toni will follow up with the Postgres team to confirm if any additional permissions are required.
