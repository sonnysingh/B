- https://jira.nz.thenational.com/browse/DASD-3005 - SQL - Database Related Consultation
- I am from the BNZ Tahi IT Platform and Asset Mgmt Team. We are trying to find a solution to automatically 'discover' the APPID that a DB instance/catalog belongs to so that we can capture it and update it accurately in the CMDB without having service owners try to do it manually if possible. Currently the APPID / Environment automatically inherits from the DB Server but may not reflect the correct APP of the DB. Therefore we want to work with you to understand if APPID is something that is coded somewhere in the database or database server or if there is another source of information that we can pull from.
