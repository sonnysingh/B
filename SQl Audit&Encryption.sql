
Scenario 
The Treasury team have an Excel Reconciliation spreadsheet which was used to connect directly to the ABS Database, however that access was removed during the ABS Plus project implementation. This has necessitated additional manual business processes for their reconciliation.
I am now looking at alternative options, with one of those being to re-connect Excel to the DB, while enabling additional DB security features (to address addressing security concerns), so my questions are the following:

Could we enable SQL Server audit logging on for this DB?

And if so, can this be enabled for this user / connection only?
This would be to minimise the performance impact to the ABS/Travis apps.


Could we enable Forced Encryption in Transit for the DB connection?

Likewise, can this be enabled for this user / connection only?
Again to minimise the performance impact.
Alternatively, do we know if the connection is already encrypted?
As my security advisor (Oliver Lineham) suggested this may already be the case (potentially TLS?)



+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  	Answers and Details
Here are several ways to confirm if your SQL Server connections use TLS and which version:

## Method 1: Query Current Connection Encryption (Easiest)

Run this query while connected from Excel or any client:

```sql
SELECT 
    session_id,
    encrypt_option,
    protocol_type,
    protocol_version,
    net_transport
FROM sys.dm_exec_connections 
WHERE session_id = @@SPID;
```

**What to look for:**
- `encrypt_option`: Shows if connection is encrypted (TRUE/FALSE)
- `protocol_type`: Usually shows 'TSQL' 
- `net_transport`: Shows 'TCP' or 'Shared memory'

## Method 2: Check All Active Connections

To see encryption status of all connections:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.session_id,
    s.login_name,
    s.host_name,
    s.program_name,
    c.encrypt_option,
    c.protocol_type,
    c.net_transport,
    c.client_net_address
FROM sys.dm_exec_connections c
INNER JOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions s ON c.session_id = s.session_id
WHERE s.is_user_process = 1
ORDER BY s.login_name;
```

## Method 3: Check SQL Server TLS Version Support

Run this to see which TLS protocols are enabled on the server:

```sql
-- Check SQL Server version (TLS support varies by version)
SELECT 
    SERVERPROPERTY('ProductVersion') AS Version,
    SERVERPROPERTY('ProductLevel') AS ServicePack,
    SERVERPROPERTY('Edition') AS Edition;
```

**TLS Support by SQL Server Version:**
- SQL Server 2016 and earlier: TLS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 (with patches)
- SQL Server 2017+: TLS 1.2 by default
- SQL Server 2019+: TLS 1.3 support (with proper OS/patches)

## Method 4: Check Windows Registry (Server Side)

On the SQL Server machine, check registry for TLS protocol settings:

**Registry paths:**
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.0
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.1
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.2
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.3
```

Look for `Enabled` (DWORD): 1 = enabled, 0 = disabled

## Method 5: Check SQL Server Error Log

Search SQL Server error logs for encryption-related entries:

```sql
EXEC xp_readerrorlog 0, 1, N'encryption';
EXEC xp_readerrorlog 0, 1, N'certificate';
EXEC xp_readerrorlog 0, 1, N'TLS';
```

## Method 6: Network Packet Capture (Advanced)

Use **Wireshark** or **Network Monitor** to capture traffic:
- Filter for SQL Server port (usually 1433)
- Look for TLS handshake packets
- Will show exact TLS version negotiated (TLS 1.0, 1.2, 1.3, etc.)

## Method 7: Check Server Configuration

Query server configuration for encryption settings:

```sql
-- Check if ForceEncryption is enabled server-wide
EXEC xp_instance_regread 
    N'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE', 
    N'SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQLServer\SuperSocketNetLib', 
    N'ForceEncryption';
```

*Note: Adjust 'MSSQL15.MSSQLSERVER' to match your SQL Server instance name/version*

## Method 8: Check Excel Connection String

In Excel, check the existing connection properties:
1. Data tab → Queries & Connections
2. Right-click the connection → Properties
3. Look at the connection string for parameters like:
   - `Encrypt=True` or `Encrypt=Yes`
   - `TrustServerCertificate=True`
   - `Use Encryption for Data=True`

## What the Results Mean

**If `encrypt_option = TRUE`:**
- Connection IS encrypted
- TLS version depends on what server and client negotiated
- Minimum TLS version used will be the highest both support

**If `encrypt_option = FALSE`:**
- Connection is NOT encrypted
- Data transmitted in plain text
- You should add `Encrypt=True` to connection string

## Recommended Action for Your Scenario

Run **Method 1** first from the Excel connection to quickly confirm current state, then use **Method 2** to see how other applications (ABS/Travis) are connecting.

Would you like help interpreting the results once you run these queries?







++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Great! **SQL Server 2022 RTM-CU12** has excellent TLS support. Here's what you need to know:

## TLS Support in SQL Server 2022 CU12

**Supported TLS Versions:**
- ✅ TLS 1.0 (deprecated, should be disabled)
- ✅ TLS 1.1 (deprecated, should be disabled)
- ✅ **TLS 1.2** (recommended minimum)
- ✅ **TLS 1.3** (fully supported and recommended)

SQL Server 2022 CU12 has full TLS 1.3 support, which is the most secure option.

## Quick Check Commands for SQL 2022

**1. Check current connection encryption:**
```sql
SELECT 
    session_id,
    encrypt_option,
    protocol_type,
    protocol_version,
    net_transport,
    auth_scheme
FROM sys.dm_exec_connections 
WHERE session_id = @@SPID;
```

**2. Check all connections to see encryption patterns:**
```sql
SELECT 
    c.session_id,
    s.login_name,
    s.host_name,
    s.program_name,
    c.encrypt_option AS [Is_Encrypted],
    c.protocol_type,
    c.net_transport,
    c.auth_scheme
FROM sys.dm_exec_connections c
INNER JOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions s ON c.session_id = s.session_id
WHERE s.is_user_process = 1
ORDER BY c.encrypt_option DESC, s.login_name;
```

**3. Verify SQL Server version and patch level:**
```sql
SELECT 
    SERVERPROPERTY('ProductVersion') AS Version,
    SERVERPROPERTY('ProductLevel') AS ServicePack,
    SERVERPROPERTY('ProductUpdateLevel') AS CU_Level,
    SERVERPROPERTY('Edition') AS Edition;
```

## Check Server-Wide Encryption Setting

For SQL 2022, check if ForceEncryption is enabled:

```sql
EXEC xp_instance_regread 
    N'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE', 
    N'SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL16.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQLServer\SuperSocketNetLib', 
    N'ForceEncryption';
```

*Note: `MSSQL16` is for SQL Server 2022. Replace `MSSQLSERVER` with your instance name if it's a named instance.*

**Result interpretation:**
- `1` = ForceEncryption is ON (all connections must be encrypted)
- `0` = ForceEncryption is OFF (encryption optional, depends on client)

## Windows Server TLS Registry Check

Since you're on SQL 2022, your Windows Server likely supports TLS 1.2 and 1.3. Check with PowerShell:

```powershell
# Check TLS 1.2
Get-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.2\Client' -Name 'Enabled' -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Get-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.2\Server' -Name 'Enabled' -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Check TLS 1.3
Get-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.3\Client' -Name 'Enabled' -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Get-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.3\Server' -Name 'Enabled' -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

## SQL Server 2022 Specific Features

SQL 2022 CU12 includes enhanced security features:

1. **TLS 1.3 Support**: Strongest encryption available
2. **Strict Connection Encryption**: New `Strict` encryption mode option
3. **Better Certificate Management**: Improved certificate validation
4. **Connection String Options**: Enhanced encryption parameters

## Recommended Excel Connection String for SQL 2022

For your Treasury Excel reconciliation, use this modern connection string format:

```
Provider=MSOLEDBSQL19;Data Source=YOUR_SERVER;Initial Catalog=ABS_Database;
Integrated Security=SSPI;Encrypt=Strict;TrustServerCertificate=No;
```

**Or for SQL Authentication:**
```
Provider=MSOLEDBSQL19;Data Source=YOUR_SERVER;Initial Catalog=ABS_Database;
User ID=TreasuryUser;Password=YourPassword;Encrypt=Strict;TrustServerCertificate=No;
```

**Key parameters:**
- `MSOLEDBSQL19` = Latest OLE DB driver (supports TLS 1.3)
- `Encrypt=Strict` = Forces encryption with certificate validation (SQL 2022 feature)
- `TrustServerCertificate=No` = Validates server certificate (more secure)

**Alternative if you don't have MSOLEDBSQL19:**
```
Provider=SQLOLEDB;Data Source=YOUR_SERVER;Initial Catalog=ABS_Database;
User ID=TreasuryUser;Password=YourPassword;Use Encryption for Data=True;
```

## Action Plan for Your Scenario

1. **Run the connection query** (Method 1 above) from current Excel connection to check if already encrypted
2. **Run the all-connections query** (Method 2) to see how ABS/Travis apps connect
3. **Check ForceEncryption setting** to understand server configuration
4. **If not encrypted**: Update Excel connection string with `Encrypt=Strict` or `Encrypt=Yes`
5. **Implement SQL Server Audit** for the Treasury user (minimal performance impact)

## Performance Note

With SQL 2022 CU12 and modern hardware:
- TLS 1.2/1.3 encryption overhead is **typically <5%** CPU impact
- For a single Excel reconciliation connection, impact is **negligible**
- ABS/Travis apps won't be affected if you only change Excel connection string

Would you like help with the SQL Server Audit setup script for the Treasury user?

The error means the registry path doesn't exist or is incorrect. Let's find the correct path for your SQL Server 2022 instance.

## Step 1: Find Your Actual Instance Registry Path

Run this query to discover your instance's registry path:

```sql
-- Get the actual registry root for your instance
DECLARE @InstanceName NVARCHAR(128)
DECLARE @RegistryPath NVARCHAR(512)

-- Get instance name
SELECT @InstanceName = CONVERT(NVARCHAR(128), SERVERPROPERTY('InstanceName'))

-- If default instance, InstanceName returns NULL
IF @InstanceName IS NULL
    SET @InstanceName = 'MSSQLSERVER'

-- Build registry path
SET @RegistryPath = 'SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server\Instance Names\SQL'

-- Check what the actual registry key is
EXEC xp_instance_regread 
    N'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE', 
    @RegistryPath,
    @InstanceName

SELECT @InstanceName AS YourInstanceName
```

This will return something like `MSSQL16.MSSQLSERVER` or `MSSQL16.YOURINSTANCENAME`

## Step 2: Check ForceEncryption with Correct Path

Once you know your instance name, try these variations:

**Option A - Using the result from Step 1:**
```sql
-- Replace 'MSSQL16.MSSQLSERVER' with your actual instance from Step 1
EXEC xp_instance_regread 
    N'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE', 
    N'SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL16.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQLServer\SuperSocketNetLib', 
    N'ForceEncryption'
```

**Option B - Try without the version number:**
```sql
EXEC xp_instance_regread 
    N'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE', 
    N'SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSSQLServer\MSSQLServer\SuperSocketNetLib', 
    N'ForceEncryption'
```

**Option C - Check if it's a named instance:**
```sql
-- If you have a named instance like SQL2022 or PROD
EXEC xp_instance_regread 
    N'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE', 
    N'SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL16.SQL2022\MSSQLServer\SuperSocketNetLib', 
    N'ForceEncryption'
```

## Alternative Method: Use SQL Server Configuration Manager

Instead of querying the registry directly, check via Configuration Manager:

**On the SQL Server:**
1. Open **SQL Server Configuration Manager**
2. Expand **SQL Server Network Configuration**
3. Click on **Protocols for [YourInstanceName]**
4. Right-click on **TCP/IP** → Properties
5. Go to the **Flags** tab
6. Look for **ForceEncryption** setting (Yes/No)

## Step 3: Query Server Properties for Network Configuration

Try this alternative approach to check encryption settings:

```sql
-- Check server network configuration
SELECT 
    name,
    value,
    value_in_use,
    description
FROM sys.configurations
WHERE name LIKE '%remote%'
   OR name LIKE '%network%'
ORDER BY name;
```

## Step 4: Check Connection Encryption Directly (Simpler Method)

Instead of checking registry, just check if current connections ARE encrypted:

```sql
-- See if connections are actually encrypted
SELECT 
    c.session_id,
    s.login_name,
    s.host_name,
    s.program_name,
    CASE c.encrypt_option 
        WHEN 'TRUE' THEN 'Encrypted'
        ELSE 'Not Encrypted'
    END AS Encryption_Status,
    c.net_transport,
    c.auth_scheme,
    s.login_time
FROM sys.dm_exec_connections c
INNER JOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions s ON c.session_id = s.session_id
WHERE s.is_user_process = 1
ORDER BY c.encrypt_option DESC, s.login_name;
```

This tells you the **actual encryption status** regardless of the registry setting.

## Step 5: Find All SQL Server Registry Paths

If you're still having trouble, enumerate all SQL Server registry keys:

```sql
-- Find all SQL Server instances registered
EXEC xp_instance_regenumvalues 
    N'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE', 
    N'SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server\Instance Names\SQL'
```

## Common Reasons for Error 2

1. **Named instance** - Not using MSSQLSERVER as default
2. **Different SQL version path** - Might be MSSQL15 (2019) not MSSQL16 (2022)
3. **Insufficient permissions** - SQL Service account may not have registry read access
4. **Non-standard installation** - SQL installed in custom location

## Quick Answer for Your Scenario

**You don't actually need to check the registry setting.** 

Just run this to see if encryption is currently being used:

```sql
SELECT 
    session_id,
    encrypt_option AS Is_Encrypted,
    net_transport,
    auth_scheme
FROM sys.dm_exec_connections 
WHERE session_id = @@SPID;
```

**Result:**
- `encrypt_option = TRUE` → Connection is encrypted (TLS is being used)
- `encrypt_option = FALSE` → Connection is NOT encrypted

This directly answers whether your current Excel connection (or any connection) is encrypted, which is what you really need to know for your Treasury reconciliation security assessment.




+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Here are the **easiest ways** to check TLS version and if encryption is used by default:

## Method 1: Check Your Current Connection (EASIEST - 10 seconds)

```sql
-- Run this from Excel or any client connection
SELECT 
    session_id,
    encrypt_option AS Is_Encrypted,
    protocol_type,
    net_transport
FROM sys.dm_exec_connections 
WHERE session_id = @@SPID;
```

**Result tells you:**
- `Is_Encrypted = TRUE` → Your connection uses TLS
- `Is_Encrypted = FALSE` → Your connection is NOT encrypted

**Limitation:** Doesn't tell you which TLS version (1.2 or 1.3)

---

## Method 2: Check All Connections (See if encryption is default)

```sql
-- See what percentage of connections are encrypted
SELECT 
    encrypt_option AS Is_Encrypted,
    COUNT(*) AS Connection_Count,
    STRING_AGG(DISTINCT s.program_name, ', ') AS Applications
FROM sys.dm_exec_connections c
INNER JOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions s ON c.session_id = s.session_id
WHERE s.is_user_process = 1
GROUP BY encrypt_option;
```

**This shows you:**
- How many connections are encrypted vs not
- Which applications (Excel, ABS, Travis) are encrypted

**If most connections show `TRUE`** → Encryption is likely enabled by default server-wide

---

## Method 3: Find Actual TLS Version (Most Accurate but Requires PowerShell)

**On the SQL Server machine**, run this PowerShell script:

```powershell
# Quick TLS check script
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 1433 -State Established | ForEach-Object {
    $conn = $_
    Write-Host "Connection from: $($conn.RemoteAddress):$($conn.RemotePort)"
}

# Check which TLS versions are enabled
Write-Host "`nTLS 1.2 Status:"
Get-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.2\Server' -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object Enabled, DisabledByDefault

Write-Host "`nTLS 1.3 Status:"
Get-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.3\Server' -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object Enabled, DisabledByDefault
```

**Results:**
- `Enabled = 1` → TLS version is enabled
- `DisabledByDefault = 0` → TLS version is used by default

---

## Method 4: Use Wireshark (See EXACT TLS version - 2 minutes)

**If you have access to capture network traffic:**

1. Download **Wireshark** (free)
2. Start capture on network interface
3. Filter: `tcp.port == 1433`
4. Connect from Excel to SQL Server
5. Look for **"Client Hello"** packet
6. Expand **Transport Layer Security → Handshake Protocol**
7. You'll see: `Version: TLS 1.2` or `Version: TLS 1.3`

**This is the ONLY way to see the actual TLS version in use.**

---

## Method 5: SQL Server Error Log Check

```sql
-- Check error log for encryption/certificate entries
EXEC sp_readerrorlog 0, 1, N'certificate'
EXEC sp_readerrorlog 0, 1, N'encryption'
```

Look for messages like:
- "The certificate was successfully loaded for encryption"
- Indicates server CAN use encryption

---

## Method 6: Check If ForceEncryption is ON (Determines default behavior)

**Using SQL Server Configuration Manager** (No registry needed):

1. Open **SQL Server Configuration Manager**
2. **SQL Server Network Configuration** → **Protocols for [Instance]**
3. Right-click **TCP/IP** → **Properties**
4. **Flags** tab → Look at **ForceEncryption**
   - **Yes** → ALL connections MUST be encrypted (TLS used by default)
   - **No** → Encryption optional (client decides)

---

## Quick Summary Table

| Method | Shows TLS Version? | Shows If Encrypted? | Requires Server Access? | Time |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------------|------|
| **DMV Query (Method 1)** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (SQL only) | 10 sec |
| **All Connections (Method 2)** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (SQL only) | 30 sec |
| **PowerShell (Method 3)** | ⚠️ Shows enabled versions | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | 2 min |
| **Wireshark (Method 4)** | ✅ Yes (exact) | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Network access | 5 min |
| **Config Manager (Method 6)** | ❌ No | ⚠️ Shows if forced | ✅ Yes | 1 min |

---

## **RECOMMENDED: Simple 2-Step Process**

### Step 1: Run this query from Excel
```sql
SELECT 
    encrypt_option AS Is_Encrypted
FROM sys.dm_exec_connections 
WHERE session_id = @@SPID;
```

### Step 2: Ask your DBA or check Configuration Manager
- Is **ForceEncryption = Yes**? 
  - If Yes → All connections use TLS by default (likely TLS 1.2 on SQL 2022)
  - If No → Encryption depends on client connection string

---

## Answer Your Two Questions

**1. "How to confirm SQL Server connections use TLS by default?"**
- Run Method 2 query to see if most connections show `encrypt_option = TRUE`
- Check ForceEncryption setting in SQL Server Configuration Manager

**2. "How to find TLS version?"**
- **Simplest:** Assume TLS 1.2 on SQL Server 2022 (unless specifically configured otherwise)
- **Accurate:** Use Wireshark (Method 4)
- **Good enough:** Check PowerShell registry (Method 3) to see what's enabled

---

**For your Treasury Excel scenario:**
Run **Method 1** right now from Excel to see if it's already encrypted. That's literally all you need to tell your security advisor (Oliver) whether the connection currently uses TLS or not.

Want me to help interpret the results once you run it?







++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Good observation! Here's why you're seeing **mixed encryption status from the same IP address**:

## Common Reasons for Mixed Encryption

### 1. **Different Connection Strings**
Different applications or users from the same machine use different connection strings:

**Encrypted connection string:**
```
Server=SQLServer;Database=ABS;Encrypt=Yes;
```

**Non-encrypted connection string:**
```
Server=SQLServer;Database=ABS;
```

### 2. **Different Client Drivers**
Run this to see which drivers are being used:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.session_id,
    s.host_name,
    s.program_name,
    c.client_net_address AS IP_Address,
    c.encrypt_option AS Is_Encrypted,
    c.net_transport,
    c.protocol_type,
    s.login_name
FROM sys.dm_exec_connections c
INNER JOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions s ON c.session_id = s.session_id
WHERE s.is_user_process = 1
  AND c.client_net_address IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY c.client_net_address, c.encrypt_option DESC;
```

**Different drivers behave differently:**
- **ODBC Driver 17+** → Encrypts by default
- **ODBC Driver 11/13** → Does NOT encrypt by default
- **SQL Server Native Client** → Does NOT encrypt by default
- **OLEDB (old)** → Does NOT encrypt by default
- **MSOLEDBSQL19** → Encrypts by default

### 3. **Different Applications**
From the same IP, you might have:
- **Excel** (not encrypted - old connection string)
- **SSMS** (encrypted - newer version defaults to encryption)
- **ABS Application** (not encrypted - legacy connection)
- **Travis Application** (not encrypted - legacy connection)
- **PowerBI** (encrypted - modern driver)

### 4. **Windows Authentication vs SQL Authentication**
Sometimes different authentication methods use different drivers:

```sql
SELECT 
    s.host_name,
    c.client_net_address AS IP,
    c.auth_scheme AS Auth_Type,
    c.encrypt_option AS Encrypted,
    s.program_name,
    COUNT(*) AS Connection_Count
FROM sys.dm_exec_connections c
INNER JOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions s ON c.session_id = s.session_id
WHERE s.is_user_process = 1
GROUP BY s.host_name, c.client_net_address, c.auth_scheme, c.encrypt_option, s.program_name
ORDER BY c.client_net_address, c.encrypt_option DESC;
```

---

## Detailed Analysis Query

Run this to see **exactly what's different** between encrypted and non-encrypted connections from the same IP:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.client_net_address AS [IP Address],
    s.host_name AS [Computer Name],
    s.login_name AS [Login],
    s.program_name AS [Application],
    c.auth_scheme AS [Auth Type],
    CASE c.encrypt_option 
        WHEN 'TRUE' THEN '✓ Encrypted'
        ELSE '✗ Not Encrypted'
    END AS [Encryption Status],
    c.net_transport AS [Protocol],
    c.protocol_type,
    s.client_interface_name AS [Client Driver],
    s.login_time
FROM sys.dm_exec_connections c
INNER JOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions s ON c.session_id = s.session_id
WHERE s.is_user_process = 1
ORDER BY 
    c.client_net_address, 
    c.encrypt_option DESC,
    s.program_name;
```

---

## What This Means For Your Scenario

**Why this is happening:**

1. **ForceEncryption is OFF** on your SQL Server
   - This means encryption is **optional** 
   - Each client connection decides whether to encrypt

2. **Your applications use different connection methods:**
   - Some apps have `Encrypt=True` in connection string → Encrypted
   - Some apps have no encryption parameter → Not encrypted
   - Some apps use newer drivers that default to encryption
   - Some apps use older drivers that don't encrypt by default

3. **This is NORMAL** when ForceEncryption is disabled

---

## What You Should Do

### For Your Treasury Excel Connection:

**Option 1: Force encryption in Excel connection string (RECOMMENDED)**
```
Provider=MSOLEDBSQL19;Data Source=YourServer;Initial Catalog=ABS;
User ID=TreasuryUser;Password=***;Encrypt=Yes;TrustServerCertificate=No;
```

This ensures **only Excel** is encrypted, without affecting ABS/Travis apps.

### Check What ABS/Travis Are Using:

```sql
-- See specifically what ABS and Travis are doing
SELECT 
    s.program_name AS Application,
    c.encrypt_option AS Encrypted,
    COUNT(*) AS Connection_Count
FROM sys.dm_exec_connections c
INNER JOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions s ON c.session_id = s.session_id
WHERE s.is_user_process = 1
  AND (s.program_name LIKE '%ABS%' OR s.program_name LIKE '%Travis%')
GROUP BY s.program_name, c.encrypt_option
ORDER BY s.program_name, c.encrypt_option DESC;
```

**If ABS/Travis show `FALSE` (not encrypted):**
- This is WHY you see mixed results
- Your concern about "not impacting ABS/Travis performance" is valid
- You can safely encrypt ONLY the Excel connection without affecting them

---

## Decision Matrix

| Scenario 												| Solution 																			| Impact on ABS/Travis |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **ABS/Travis are NOT encrypted** | Add `Encrypt=Yes` to Excel connection string only | ✅ Zero impact |
| **ABS/Travis ARE encrypted** | Add `Encrypt=Yes` to Excel connection string | ✅ Zero impact (already encrypted) |
| **Mixed ABS/Travis connections** | Add `Encrypt=Yes` to Excel connection string | ✅ Zero impact |

---

## Summary Answer

**Why same IP has both TRUE and FALSE?**
- Different applications/users from that machine use different connection strings and drivers
- Some explicitly request encryption (`Encrypt=Yes`), some don't
- This is normal when server ForceEncryption is OFF

**What this means for you:**
- ✅ You CAN encrypt just the Excel connection without affecting ABS/Travis
- ✅ Add `Encrypt=Yes` to Excel's connection string
- ✅ ABS/Travis will continue exactly as they are now
- ✅ Zero performance impact on existing applications

**Next step:**
Run the detailed analysis query above to confirm which specific applications (Excel, ABS, Travis) are encrypted vs not encrypted. This will give you the full picture for your security assessment.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++		Scripts SQL Server Audit setup for the Treasury user


Great! Here's a complete SQL Server Audit setup for the Treasury user. I'll provide scripts that are specific to SQL Server 2022 and focused on your reconciliation scenario.

## Step 1: Determine What to Audit

First, let's identify what the Treasury user will be accessing:

```sql
-- Check if the Treasury user/login already exists
SELECT 
    name AS LoginName,
    type_desc AS LoginType,
    create_date,
    is_disabled
FROM sys.server_principals
WHERE name LIKE '%Treasury%' OR name LIKE '%Reconcil%';

-- Check database users
USE ABS_Database;  -- Replace with your actual database name
GO

SELECT 
    name AS UserName,
    type_desc AS UserType,
    create_date
FROM sys.database_principals
WHERE name LIKE '%Treasury%' OR name LIKE '%Reconcil%';
```

---

## Step 2: Create Dedicated Treasury Login and User (If Needed)

```sql
-- Create SQL Server login for Treasury Excel connection
USE master;
GO

CREATE LOGIN TreasuryReconciliation 
WITH PASSWORD = 'YourSecurePassword123!',  -- Change this!
     DEFAULT_DATABASE = ABS_Database,
     CHECK_POLICY = ON,
     CHECK_EXPIRATION = OFF;
GO

-- Create database user
USE ABS_Database;  -- Replace with your actual database name
GO

CREATE USER TreasuryReconciliation 
FOR LOGIN TreasuryReconciliation;
GO

-- Grant READ-ONLY access to specific schema or tables
-- Option A: Grant to entire database (read-only)
ALTER ROLE db_datareader ADD MEMBER TreasuryReconciliation;
GO

-- Option B: Grant to specific tables only (more secure)
-- GRANT SELECT ON dbo.Transactions TO TreasuryReconciliation;
-- GRANT SELECT ON dbo.Reconciliation TO TreasuryReconciliation;
-- GRANT SELECT ON dbo.FinancialData TO TreasuryReconciliation;
GO
```

---

## Step 3: Create Server Audit Object

```sql
USE master;
GO

-- Create the audit object (writes to file system)
CREATE SERVER AUDIT TreasuryUserAudit
TO FILE 
(
    FILEPATH = 'C:\SQLAudit\Treasury\',  -- Change to your audit folder
    MAXSIZE = 100 MB,
    MAX_ROLLOVER_FILES = 10,
    RESERVE_DISK_SPACE = OFF
)
WITH 
(
    QUEUE_DELAY = 1000,  -- 1 second delay (minimal performance impact)
    ON_FAILURE = CONTINUE  -- Don't block connections if audit fails
);
GO

-- Enable the audit
ALTER SERVER AUDIT TreasuryUserAudit
WITH (STATE = ON);
GO
```

**Note:** Make sure the folder `C:\SQLAudit\Treasury\` exists and SQL Server service account has write permissions.

---

## Step 4: Create Database Audit Specification (What to Audit)

```sql
USE ABS_Database;  -- Replace with your actual database name
GO

-- Create audit specification for Treasury user activities
CREATE DATABASE AUDIT SPECIFICATION TreasuryReconciliationAudit
FOR SERVER AUDIT TreasuryUserAudit
ADD (SELECT ON DATABASE::ABS_Database BY TreasuryReconciliation),  -- All SELECT queries
ADD (INSERT ON DATABASE::ABS_Database BY TreasuryReconciliation),  -- Should be none, but audit just in case
ADD (UPDATE ON DATABASE::ABS_Database BY TreasuryReconciliation),  -- Should be none, but audit just in case
ADD (DELETE ON DATABASE::ABS_Database BY TreasuryReconciliation),  -- Should be none, but audit just in case
ADD (EXECUTE ON DATABASE::ABS_Database BY TreasuryReconciliation)  -- Stored procedures
WITH (STATE = ON);
GO
```

---

## Step 5: Create Server Audit Specification (Login Events)

```sql
USE master;
GO

-- Audit login attempts and failures
CREATE SERVER AUDIT SPECIFICATION TreasuryLoginAudit
FOR SERVER AUDIT TreasuryUserAudit
ADD (FAILED_LOGIN_GROUP),
ADD (SUCCESSFUL_LOGIN_GROUP)
WITH (STATE = ON);
GO
```

---

## Step 6: Verify Audit is Working

```sql
-- Check audit status
SELECT 
    name,
    type_desc,
    on_failure_desc,
    is_state_enabled
FROM sys.server_audits;

-- Check server audit specifications
SELECT 
    a.name AS AuditName,
    s.name AS SpecificationName,
    s.is_state_enabled
FROM sys.server_audits a
INNER JOIN sys.server_audit_specifications s ON a.audit_guid = s.audit_guid;

-- Check database audit specifications
SELECT 
    a.name AS AuditName,
    d.name AS SpecificationName,
    d.is_state_enabled,
    d.create_date
FROM sys.server_audits a
INNER JOIN sys.database_audit_specifications d ON a.audit_guid = d.audit_guid;
```

---

## Step 7: Test the Audit

```sql
-- Simulate Treasury user connection (run as TreasuryReconciliation user)
-- Then check audit logs

-- View audit logs
SELECT 
    event_time,
    action_id,
    succeeded,
    session_server_principal_name AS [User],
    server_instance_name,
    database_name,
    schema_name,
    object_name,
    statement,
    client_ip,
    application_name
FROM sys.fn_get_audit_file('C:\SQLAudit\Treasury\*.sqlaudit', DEFAULT, DEFAULT)
WHERE session_server_principal_name = 'TreasuryReconciliation'
ORDER BY event_time DESC;
```

---

## Step 8: Create a Monitoring Query (For Regular Review)

```sql
-- Daily review query for Treasury user activities
SELECT 
    CONVERT(DATE, event_time) AS AuditDate,
    COUNT(*) AS TotalQueries,
    COUNT(DISTINCT client_ip) AS UniqueIPs,
    COUNT(DISTINCT application_name) AS UniqueApplications,
    SUM(CASE WHEN succeeded = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS SuccessfulActions,
    SUM(CASE WHEN succeeded = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS FailedActions
FROM sys.fn_get_audit_file('C:\SQLAudit\Treasury\*.sqlaudit', DEFAULT, DEFAULT)
WHERE session_server_principal_name = 'TreasuryReconciliation'
GROUP BY CONVERT(DATE, event_time)
ORDER BY AuditDate DESC;

-- Detailed view of recent activities
SELECT TOP 100
    event_time,
    CASE action_id
        WHEN 'SL' THEN 'SELECT'
        WHEN 'IN' THEN 'INSERT'
        WHEN 'UP' THEN 'UPDATE'
        WHEN 'DL' THEN 'DELETE'
        WHEN 'EX' THEN 'EXECUTE'
        WHEN 'LGIS' THEN 'LOGIN SUCCESS'
        WHEN 'LGIF' THEN 'LOGIN FAILED'
        ELSE action_id
    END AS Action,
    succeeded,
    database_name,
    schema_name,
    object_name,
    statement,
    client_ip,
    application_name,
    host_name
FROM sys.fn_get_audit_file('C:\SQLAudit\Treasury\*.sqlaudit', DEFAULT, DEFAULT)
WHERE session_server_principal_name = 'TreasuryReconciliation'
ORDER BY event_time DESC;
```

---

## Step 9: Performance Impact Check

```sql
-- Monitor audit performance impact
SELECT 
    audit_file_name,
    audit_file_size,
    create_time,
    last_write_time
FROM sys.dm_server_audit_status;

-- Check if audit queue is backing up (indicates performance issue)
SELECT 
    name,
    queue_delay,
    on_failure_desc,
    is_state_enabled
FROM sys.server_audits;
```

---

## Optional: Audit Specific Tables Only (More Targeted)

If you want to audit only specific tables the Treasury team accesses:

```sql
USE ABS_Database;
GO

-- Drop existing specification if you want to replace it
-- DROP DATABASE AUDIT SPECIFICATION TreasuryReconciliationAudit;
-- GO

-- Create more targeted audit (specific tables only)
CREATE DATABASE AUDIT SPECIFICATION TreasuryReconciliationAudit_Targeted
FOR SERVER AUDIT TreasuryUserAudit
ADD (SELECT ON OBJECT::dbo.Transactions BY TreasuryReconciliation),
ADD (SELECT ON OBJECT::dbo.AccountBalances BY TreasuryReconciliation),
ADD (SELECT ON OBJECT::dbo.ReconciliationData BY TreasuryReconciliation)
-- Add more tables as needed
WITH (STATE = ON);
GO
```

---

## Step 10: Alert Setup (Optional - for Security Team)

Create an alert for suspicious activity:

```sql
-- Create a stored procedure to check for suspicious patterns
USE ABS_Database;
GO

CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE dbo.usp_CheckTreasuryAuditAlerts
AS
BEGIN
    -- Check for excessive queries (potential data extraction)
    DECLARE @ExcessiveQueryCount INT = 0;
    
    SELECT @ExcessiveQueryCount = COUNT(*)
    FROM sys.fn_get_audit_file('C:\SQLAudit\Treasury\*.sqlaudit', DEFAULT, DEFAULT)
    WHERE session_server_principal_name = 'TreasuryReconciliation'
      AND event_time >= DATEADD(HOUR, -1, GETDATE());
    
    IF @ExcessiveQueryCount > 1000  -- Threshold: 1000 queries per hour
    BEGIN
        -- Send alert (configure Database Mail first)
        EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_send_dbmail
            @profile_name = 'YourMailProfile',
            @recipients = 'dba@yourcompany.com;security@yourcompany.com',
            @subject = 'ALERT: Excessive Treasury User Activity',
            @body = 'Treasury user has executed over 1000 queries in the last hour. Please investigate.';
    END;
    
    -- Check for failed login attempts
    DECLARE @FailedLogins INT = 0;
    
    SELECT @FailedLogins = COUNT(*)
    FROM sys.fn_get_audit_file('C:\SQLAudit\Treasury\*.sqlaudit', DEFAULT, DEFAULT)
    WHERE session_server_principal_name = 'TreasuryReconciliation'
      AND action_id = 'LGIF'  -- Login Failed
      AND event_time >= DATEADD(HOUR, -1, GETDATE());
    
    IF @FailedLogins > 5  -- Threshold: 5 failed logins per hour
    BEGIN
        EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_send_dbmail
            @profile_name = 'YourMailProfile',
            @recipients = 'dba@yourcompany.com;security@yourcompany.com',
            @subject = 'ALERT: Multiple Failed Login Attempts - Treasury User',
            @body = 'Multiple failed login attempts detected for Treasury user. Possible security breach.';
    END;
END;
GO

-- Schedule this to run hourly via SQL Agent
```

---

## Excel Connection String Update

Update your Excel connection to use the new audited login:

```
Provider=MSOLEDBSQL19;
Data Source=YourSQLServer;
Initial Catalog=ABS_Database;
User ID=TreasuryReconciliation;
Password=YourSecurePassword123!;
Encrypt=Yes;
TrustServerCertificate=No;
```

---

## Maintenance Script

```sql
-- Clean up old audit files (run monthly)
-- Keep last 90 days of audit logs
DECLARE @CutoffDate DATETIME = DATEADD(DAY, -90, GETDATE());

-- This requires manual file deletion or SQL Agent job with xp_cmdshell
-- Or configure MAX_ROLLOVER_FILES appropriately in the audit definition
```

---

## Summary of What This Audit Captures

✅ **All SELECT queries** by Treasury user  
✅ **All INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE attempts** (should be none for read-only)  
✅ **All login attempts** (successful and failed)  
✅ **Timestamp, IP address, application name** for each action  
✅ **Specific tables/objects accessed**  
✅ **Query text** (what data was retrieved)  

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal** - Queue delay of 1 second
- **Disk space** - ~100MB per rollover file, 10 files max (1GB total)
- **CPU overhead** - Typically <1% for single user auditing
- **No impact on ABS/Travis** - Only audits TreasuryReconciliation user

---

Would you like me to help you customize any of these scripts for your specific table names or requirements?





+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++		 Excel connection user

**Yes, absolutely!** This audit setup works for the Excel connection user.

Let me clarify how it works:

## How It Works for Excel

When you connect from Excel using the **TreasuryReconciliation** login, the audit captures:

1. ✅ **When Excel connects** to SQL Server (login event)
2. ✅ **Every query Excel sends** (all SELECT statements)
3. ✅ **Which tables Excel accesses** (from the reconciliation spreadsheet)
4. ✅ **The computer/IP Excel connects from** (Treasury team member's PC)
5. ✅ **The application name** (will show as "Microsoft Excel" or similar)

## What Gets Audited

When someone opens the Excel reconciliation spreadsheet and refreshes data:

```sql
-- You'll see audit entries like this:
Event Time: 2025-10-01 09:15:23
User: TreasuryReconciliation
Action: SELECT
Database: ABS_Database
Table: dbo.Transactions
Statement: SELECT * FROM Transactions WHERE Date >= '2025-01-01'
Client IP: 192.168.1.105
Application: Microsoft Office Excel
Host Name: TREASURY-PC-01
Result: Success
```

## Key Points

### ✅ Excel Connection IS Audited
- The audit is tied to the **LOGIN NAME** (TreasuryReconciliation)
- Doesn't matter if it's Excel, SSMS, PowerBI, or any other tool
- **ANY** connection using that login gets audited

### ✅ Shows Excel-Specific Details
The audit will show:
- `application_name` = "Microsoft Excel" (or similar)
- `host_name` = The Treasury team member's computer name
- `client_ip` = Their IP address
- Exact queries Excel sends when refreshing data

### ✅ No Impact on Other Users
- Only audits the **TreasuryReconciliation** user
- ABS/Travis apps use different logins → NOT audited
- Zero performance impact on them

---

## Verification: Check Excel Connection is Being Audited

### Step 1: Connect from Excel
Update Excel connection string to use the audited login:
```
Provider=MSOLEDBSQL19;
Data Source=YourSQLServer;
Initial Catalog=ABS_Database;
User ID=TreasuryReconciliation;
Password=YourSecurePassword123!;
Encrypt=Yes;
```

### Step 2: Refresh Data in Excel
Just refresh your reconciliation data in Excel (clicking "Refresh All" or similar)

### Step 3: Check the Audit Log
Run this query to see Excel activity:

```sql
-- View Excel connection audit entries
SELECT 
    event_time,
    CASE action_id
        WHEN 'SL' THEN 'SELECT'
        WHEN 'LGIS' THEN 'LOGIN SUCCESS'
        ELSE action_id
    END AS Action,
    database_name,
    schema_name,
    object_name,
    statement,
    client_ip,
    application_name,  -- Will show "Microsoft Excel"
    host_name,         -- Treasury PC name
    succeeded
FROM sys.fn_get_audit_file('C:\SQLAudit\Treasury\*.sqlaudit', DEFAULT, DEFAULT)
WHERE session_server_principal_name = 'TreasuryReconciliation'
  AND application_name LIKE '%Excel%'
ORDER BY event_time DESC;
```

You should see entries showing:
- Login from Excel
- SELECT queries Excel executed
- Tables accessed
- Treasury team member's computer name

---

## What If Excel Uses Windows Authentication?

If your Excel connection currently uses **Windows Authentication** (Integrated Security) instead of a SQL login, you need a slightly different approach:

### Option A: Switch Excel to SQL Authentication (Recommended)
Use the TreasuryReconciliation SQL login as shown above - **easiest to audit**

### Option B: Audit Windows Login
If Excel must use Windows Authentication (e.g., `DOMAIN\TreasuryUser`):

```sql
USE ABS_Database;
GO

-- Audit specific Windows user instead
CREATE DATABASE AUDIT SPECIFICATION TreasuryWindowsUserAudit
FOR SERVER AUDIT TreasuryUserAudit
ADD (SELECT ON DATABASE::ABS_Database BY [DOMAIN\TreasuryUser]),  -- Replace with actual Windows account
ADD (INSERT ON DATABASE::ABS_Database BY [DOMAIN\TreasuryUser]),
ADD (UPDATE ON DATABASE::ABS_Database BY [DOMAIN\TreasuryUser]),
ADD (DELETE ON DATABASE::ABS_Database BY [DOMAIN\TreasuryUser])
WITH (STATE = ON);
GO
```

### Option C: Audit a Windows Group
If multiple Treasury team members connect:

```sql
-- Audit everyone in a Windows group
CREATE DATABASE AUDIT SPECIFICATION TreasuryGroupAudit
FOR SERVER AUDIT TreasuryUserAudit
ADD (SELECT ON DATABASE::ABS_Database BY [DOMAIN\TreasuryTeam]),  -- Windows AD group
ADD (INSERT ON DATABASE::ABS_Database BY [DOMAIN\TreasuryTeam]),
ADD (UPDATE ON DATABASE::ABS_Database BY [DOMAIN\TreasuryTeam]),
ADD (DELETE ON DATABASE::ABS_Database BY [DOMAIN\TreasuryTeam])
WITH (STATE = ON);
GO
```

---

## Quick Check: What Login Does Excel Currently Use?

Run this while Excel is connected:

```sql
-- See current Excel connections
SELECT 
    s.session_id,
    s.login_name,           -- Shows which login Excel is using
    s.host_name,            -- Treasury PC name
    s.program_name,         -- Should show Excel
    c.client_net_address,   -- IP address
    c.encrypt_option,       -- Check if encrypted
    c.auth_scheme           -- NTLM (Windows Auth) or SQL
FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions s
INNER JOIN sys.dm_exec_connections c ON s.session_id = c.session_id
WHERE s.program_name LIKE '%Excel%'
   OR s.program_name LIKE '%Office%';
```

This tells you:
- **If `login_name` shows a SQL login** → Use the audit script I provided (works perfectly)
- **If `login_name` shows DOMAIN\Username** → You need Option B or C above

---

## Summary

**Question:** Is the audit for Excel connection user as well?

**Answer:** **YES!** 

- The audit captures **ANY** connection using the TreasuryReconciliation login
- Excel is just one of the applications that can use that login
- The audit logs will specifically show "Microsoft Excel" in the `application_name` field
- You'll see every query Excel sends when refreshing reconciliation data
- This gives your security advisor (Oliver) full visibility into Treasury's data access

**Next Step:** Update Excel connection string to use `TreasuryReconciliation` login, refresh data, then check the audit log to confirm it's working!

Want help checking what login Excel currently uses, or adjusting the audit if it's using Windows Authentication?








+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++	EXEC sp_readerrorlog 0, 1, N'encryption' 


Perfect! That message tells us something very important:

## What This Means

**"The certificate [cert hash/SHA1: ...] was successfully loaded for encryption"**

This means:

✅ **SQL Server HAS a certificate installed**  
✅ **The certificate is valid and loaded**  
✅ **SQL Server is CAPABLE of encrypting connections**  
✅ **TLS encryption is available** (using this certificate)

---

## But Does This Mean Connections ARE Encrypted?

**Not necessarily.** This only means encryption is **available**, not that it's **enforced**.

Think of it like this:
- 🔐 The certificate = Having a lock installed on your door
- 🚪 ForceEncryption = Whether the door must be locked
- 🔑 Connection string Encrypt=Yes = Whether someone actually locks it

---

## What You Need to Check Next

### Check if encryption is ENFORCED (ForceEncryption):

Since the registry query failed earlier, use **SQL Server Configuration Manager**:

1. Open **SQL Server Configuration Manager**
2. Go to **SQL Server Network Configuration**
3. Click **Protocols for [Your Instance]**
4. Right-click **TCP/IP** → **Properties**
5. Go to **Flags** tab
6. Look at **ForceEncryption** setting

**Result meanings:**
- **ForceEncryption = Yes** → ALL connections MUST use TLS (certificate is used automatically)
- **ForceEncryption = No** → Encryption is optional (depends on client connection string)

---

## Alternative: Check Current Connections

Run this to see if connections are **actually using** the certificate for encryption:

```sql
-- Check if connections are encrypted
SELECT 
    s.session_id,
    s.login_name,
    s.program_name,
    s.host_name,
    c.encrypt_option AS Is_Encrypted,
    c.client_net_address AS IP_Address,
    CASE c.encrypt_option
        WHEN 'TRUE' THEN NCHAR(10003) + '  Using certificate/TLS'
        ELSE  NCHAR(10007) + '  Not encrypted (certificate available but not used)'
    END AS Encryption_Status
FROM sys.dm_exec_connections c
INNER JOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions s ON c.session_id = s.session_id
WHERE s.is_user_process = 1
ORDER BY c.encrypt_option DESC, s.program_name;
```

---

## Summary of Your Situation

Based on the error log message:

| Status | What We Know |
|--------|--------------|
| ✅ Certificate exists | Yes - loaded successfully |
| ✅ TLS available | Yes - can encrypt connections |
| ❓ Encryption enforced | **Unknown** - need to check ForceEncryption setting |
| ❓ Connections encrypted | **Mixed** - some TRUE, some FALSE (from your earlier check) |

---

## What This Means for Your Treasury Excel Connection

**Good news:**
- The certificate is there and working
- When you add `Encrypt=Yes` to Excel connection string, it WILL use TLS encryption
- The certificate/TLS infrastructure is already set up

**Action needed:**
- Update Excel connection string to include `Encrypt=Yes` or `Encrypt=Strict`
- This will force Excel to use the certificate for TLS encryption
- No server changes needed - certificate is already loaded and ready

---

## Recommended Connection String for Excel

Since the certificate is loaded and working:

```
Provider=MSOLEDBSQL19;
Data Source=YourSQLServer;
Initial Catalog=ABS_Database;
User ID=TreasuryReconciliation;
Password=YourSecurePassword123!;
Encrypt=Yes;
TrustServerCertificate=No;
```

**Or if using Windows Authentication:**
```
Provider=MSOLEDBSQL19;
Data Source=YourSQLServer;
Initial Catalog=ABS_Database;
Integrated Security=SSPI;
Encrypt=Yes;
TrustServerCertificate=No;
```

**The `Encrypt=Yes` parameter will use the certificate you just confirmed exists!**

---

## TLS Version

Since you have:
- SQL Server 2022 CU12
- A valid certificate loaded
- Modern Windows Server (likely)

The connection will likely use **TLS 1.2** or **TLS 1.3** by default.

To confirm exact TLS version, you'd need Wireshark (as mentioned earlier), but for your security assessment, you can confidently say:

> "SQL Server has a valid encryption certificate loaded. When we add `Encrypt=Yes` to the Excel connection string, it will use TLS 1.2 or 1.3 encryption (SQL Server 2022 default)."

---

## Tell Your Security Advisor (Oliver)

You can report:

✅ **Certificate Status:** Valid certificate loaded and ready  
✅ **TLS Available:** Yes, TLS encryption is available  
✅ **Current State:** Some connections encrypted, some not (ForceEncryption is OFF)  
✅ **Excel Solution:** Add `Encrypt=Yes` to connection string - will use existing certificate  
✅ **Impact:** Zero impact on ABS/Travis (they continue as-is)  
✅ **Audit:** Can track all Excel queries via SQL Server Audit
