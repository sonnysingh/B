- INC006878754 ( SQLServerException: Read timed out ) - 1.5 hrs
Hi Salvador
	- Investigation conducted and here are the findings...
		"com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException: Read timed out | Caused by: java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out"
		- Java application try to run a query, but the database did not respond within the configured timeout window.
		Common Cause:-
		1 - Long running SQL query - taking too long due to either missing indexes, large dataset, blocking/locking issues etc..
		2- Network latency or firewall - database server may slow to respond due to network issues, firewall inspection, or packet drop.
		3- JDBC timeout configuration - What is JDBC socket timeout ? Can you share pls?
		4- Database Load - SQL Server might be under heavy CPU, IO or blocking pressure

		To investigate further, could you please provide:-
		1- The exact query being executed when the timeout occurs.
		2- What is timestamp of recent timeout occurrences ?
		3- How often it happen?
		4- The JDBC connection string you're using, especially the timeout values
		This will help me determine if the issue is query performance or application side timeout.

INC006846722 - sorbspsqlp01:Drive Q: has 7% space left
https://jira.nz.thenational.com/browse/PGSD-2691
Can we please get drive Q extended on the below servers by 500GB:
SORBSPSQLP01
SORBSPSQLP02
SETTSPSQLP21
The drive currently has less than 10% free space. INC005898722 has been generated by ServiceNow.



INC006591021 - settbisqlp04:Drive J: has 1% space left
Erica - Pending Server Builds in next Quarter.
18/07/25 Requested Possibility of setting these up as Problem tickets / or how to handle the repeating disk space alerts.
From Compute: If you need disks larger than 2TB then you could request new disks partitioned as GPT and migrate the data between them.
SETTBISQLP04 - O Drive is using MBR instead of GPT so cannot be expanded more than it's current size.
SORBBISQLP04 - J and O Drive are both using MBR instead of GPT so cannot be expanded more than it's current size.
