- Task 1 - backup the dev db “UPI” in sql server “saueessqd51” (it is in Azure) and restore it onto on premise sql server “swlgdmsqld01”. This allows us to develop and test the new report.
	- Review the source and destnation server. Spce review. Backup DB.
	- No access for shared drive. discuss with Anna and Deepa and then Li.Li shared the way network folders.
	- Copy the backup of 8.5 GB and let Li know.
	- But source and destination SQL Server are diff version, Destination (2014) is lower than Source (2019)
	- discus with Li and She mentioned "Ah, right, right! Sorry, did not realised that. Hm, might be an  issue since our on premise sql servers are all 2014 except for the new ABS servers set up. The new ABS dev sql server is SWVDABSSQL01 which has sqlserver 2022 I think. If you restore the db there, you might need to create sql logins for those db users in UPI db, right?"
